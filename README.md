# 🦟 Outbreak Zero – Dengue Prevention Platform

## 📖 Project Overview
Climate change is intensifying the frequency, scale, and unpredictability of dengue outbreaks in Vietnam, particularly in vulnerable regions such as the Mekong Delta. Existing healthcare responses remain largely **reactive**, constrained by delayed reporting, fragmented data, and limited predictive capability.

**Outbreak Zero** is a technology-driven platform that aims to transform dengue prevention from reaction to **proactive, community-powered intervention**, combining AI-driven risk prediction, real-time data, and citizen engagement.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Climate change is driving sudden and severe dengue outbreaks in Vietnam, while the healthcare system remains largely reactive due to the lack of real-time data and predictive intelligence.

---

## 💡 Solution Statement
**Outbreak Zero** is an **AI-powered, gamified dengue prevention platform** designed for deployment in the Mekong Delta under climate change conditions.

By analyzing **real-time climate and contextual data**, the system predicts dengue outbreak risks and delivers **location-based alerts** before case numbers surge. Instead of relying solely on institutional response, the platform empowers citizens to take preventive action early.

Users receive **GPS-based preventive missions** that translate public health guidelines into **concrete, verifiable actions**, such as removing mosquito breeding sites. Participation is reinforced through **gamification mechanics** and **real-world incentives**.

To ensure credibility and measurable impact, **AI-based verification** validates user-submitted evidence, aligning individual behavior change with broader public health outcomes.
